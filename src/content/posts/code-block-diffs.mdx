I recently found myself wanting to show diffs in my code blocks. You know the ones, some `+` and `-` that are colour coded. The use case is that you are writing a tutorial piece and want to explain to the reader some concept then you want to add to that or show an alternative way of doing it. Let's take a look by creating a silly function.

```typescript
function CreatePerson({name: string, age: number}) {
    return {
        name,
        age
    }
}
```

```diff
- function CreatePerson({name: string, age: number}) {
+ function CreatePerson({name: string, age: number, favoriteColour: string}) {
    return {
        name,
-       age
+       age,
+       favoriteColour
    }
}
```

So this is possible by literally adding a `-` where you want to show the line that is being replaced, and a `+` for the line that is added/changed. You'll also need to add the `diff` keyword to the codeblock as a variable as you would to define the langue of the codeblock.
