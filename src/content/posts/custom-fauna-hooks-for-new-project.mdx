title: Custom FaunaDB hooks for new project

I've got a new project on my mind. It's going to be a mobile app created with
[Expo](https://expo.io/) and [FaunaDB](https://fauna.com/). I know that Fauna
can handle user authentication, im currently unsure if I will use that or not as
I might want to implement social logins such as Facebook, Google and Twitter.
I've used Firebase for this purpose before so am thinking I could match up the
two with Fauna handling all the data requirements of the app and Firebase
handling the user logins. That being said, the users data will be stored in
Fauna so I might have to store it twice. This part will need some more
consideration.

I have 3 children and those that have children know that as soon as you buy some
piece of clothing for them they seem to instantly grow out of it, thus you are
left with basically new or totally destroyed clothing. The same can be said of
many toys. In fact, basically anything my children own, they seem to have for a
short period of time giving to outgrowing, un-interest or destruction. ðŸ˜†

Where I live there are a few Facebook groups that parents can post unused or
secondhand items for sale, and this is great! But there are certain things that
you can't do in a Facebook group that sells stuff, its quite ridged. Making an
app for the same purpose, I could add all the missing features. Also, all the
users information would 100% not be shared with anyone, unlike what some big
social media companies have been known to do. ðŸ˜œ

This is still very early doors but like every good programmer, I started coding
before I started planning. I decided to play around with fetching data from
Fauna by making some simple React hooks. Right now I only have two and im sure
they could be improved upon. This gist is this:

- I have a React context provider which I pass the Fauna secret to and wrap my
  apps root with
- Inside the provider I take secret, establish a connection with Fauna and pass
  the client and query objects to the exported provider
- The two hooks follow a common pattern for fetching data with 3 states,
  response, error and loading which they return.
- The hook to get all the data takes the collection index and limit as props
  then inside useEffect I create a paginated query for the index with the limit
  secret
- The hook to get a single item is much the same except it takes the collection
  index and the id of the item to be fetched. The Fauna query uses the Get
  function to find a match for the id from the collections index

The [Fauna Query Language (FQL)](https://docs.fauna.com/fauna/current/api/fql/)
seems so expansive, im really looking forward to diving into it deeper into it
and creating the mutation hooks. Its nice practice not only of creating custom
hooks, but also learning FQL. Not only that, I like the abstraction, all that
logic in one place then just import the hooks and get the data!

It wouldn't be any fun if I didn't share how it was going would it? ðŸ˜„

## Fauna Context provider

```jsx
import * as React from 'react';
const faunadb = require('faunadb');
const q = faunadb.query;

export const FaunaContext = React.createContext();

export const FaunaProvider = ({ children, faunaSecret }) => {
  const fauna = React.useMemo(() => {
    if (!faunaSecret) {
      throw new Error(`No faunaSecret found, skipping client creation`);
    }
    const client = new faunadb.Client({
      secret: faunaSecret,
    });
    return { client, q };
  }, [faunaSecret]);
  return (
    <FaunaContext.Provider value={fauna}>{children}</FaunaContext.Provider>
  );
};
```

Then to wrap the root element of any app:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { FaunaProvider } from 'hooks';

import App from './App';

ReactDOM.render(
  <FaunaProvider faunaSecret={process.env.FAUNA_SECRET}>
    <App />
  </FaunaProvider>,
  document.getElementById('root'),
);
```

## useFaunaGetAll

```js
export const useFaunaGetAll = (collectionIndex, limit) => {
  const fauna = React.useContext(FaunaContext);
  const [response, setResponse] = React.useState(null);
  const [error, setError] = React.useState(null);
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = React.useState(false);

  React.useEffect(() => {
    const getAll = async () => {
      setIsLoading(true);
      try {
        fauna.client
          .query(
            fauna.q.Map(
              fauna.q.Paginate(fauna.q.Match(fauna.q.Index(collectionIndex)), {
                size: limit,
              }),
              fauna.q.Lambda(
                'ref',
                fauna.q.Select(['data'], fauna.q.Get(fauna.q.Var('ref'))),
              ),
            ),
          )
          .then((result) => {
            setResponse(result.data);
            setIsLoading(false);
          });
      } catch (error) {
        setError(error);
      }
      setIsLoading(false);
    };
    getAll();
  }, [collectionIndex]);

  return { response, error, isLoading };
};
```

## useFaunaGetSingle

```js
export const useFaunaGetSingle = (collectionIndex, id) => {
  const fauna = React.useContext(FaunaContext);
  const [response, setResponse] = React.useState(null);
  const [error, setError] = React.useState(null);
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = React.useState(false);

  React.useEffect(() => {
    const getSingle = async () => {
      setIsLoading(true);
      try {
        fauna.client
          .query(fauna.q.Get(fauna.q.Match(fauna.q.Index(collectionIndex), id)))
          .then((result) => {
            setResponse(result.data);
            setIsLoading(false);
          });
      } catch (error) {
        setError(error);
      }
      setIsLoading(false);
    };
    getSingle();
  }, [id]);

  return { response, error, isLoading };
};
```

## Usage

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { useFaunaGetAll, useFaunaGetSingle } from 'hooks';

const App = () => {
  const single = useFaunaGetSingle('characterById', '5a109e543dc2080021cd8790');
  const data = useFaunaGetAll('allCharacters', 10);
  return (
    <div>
      dum de dum dum
      {single.isLoading || single.response === null ? (
        <h1>Loading.....</h1>
      ) : (
        <h1>{single.response.name}</h1>
      )}
      {data.isLoading || data.response === null ? (
        <h1>Loading Data.....</h1>
      ) : (
        <ul>
          {data.response.map((item) => (
            <li key={item._id}>{item.name}</li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};
export default App;
```

Obviously there is work to be done but its a start! Now, back to planning! ðŸ’ƒðŸ•º
