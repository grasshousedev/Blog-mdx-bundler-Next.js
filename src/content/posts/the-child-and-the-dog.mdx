## The child

The child walked in the woods, hunched over and slow paced. They held a long sharpened stick in one hand and an old pair of binoculars in the other.

Their destination was an old rickety bridge up ahead, the final stop on a long voyage. The elders of the village had foretold this moment, the child was not expected back in any case.

It stopped at the cliff edge and whispered "reprieve me".

## The dog

The dog paused for a moment and sniffed the air, something clung to the breeze that reminded it of home. Deciding it was nothing, it continued along the broken cliff edge path.

Even the smell of easy prey would not deter its mission, the bridge was up ahead and there was no going back now.


## The bridge

The bridge swung in the breeze, it was long and as old as the mountains themselves. Held together by a patchwork of old ropes and twine, it had seen many feet and known many journeys.

The child sunk to its knees and pulled out the binoculars. It could see the dog starting to make its way across the bridge in the distance, and decided to do the same. They would meet in the middle it thought. Fate had given them that much.

As they both began their slow walk across, the clouds created a distant floor over which the bridge swung. Until finally, the two travellers stood face to face for the first, and final time.
