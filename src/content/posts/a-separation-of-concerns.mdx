I was having a conversation with my wife about her career direction, not what she wanted to do but the supporting scaffolding around it. We reached the point where we started to discuss how to maximize her authority in her field. For context, my wife is a nurse and wants to go private into a field that is relatively unknown territory within the industry. Rather than prescribing medicines for ailments, or in her case being a nurse, treating these ailments, she wants to study what is actually wrong with people and diagnose treatment via lab test results and lifestyle changes.

She loves to read up on things and take notes on her findings, always planning, always taking notes and organizing her thoughts. She had suggested that at some point she wanted to start a blog, but only when she had finished studying and had the knowledge to confidently offer the advice for which she held.

It was at this point that I mentioned the concept of a digital garden. I suggested to her that she could instead of focusing on producing one article to rule them all, one article that would be the definitive answer to a question, focus on transferring her research notes to blog posts. Take every small piece of information that she had learnt and scribble it down on a computer and publish it as is. Once she had enough of these notes to form a whole she could refactor them into one article that would outline the thought as a whole.

This to me is what represents what you can do with a garden. There are no hard and fast rules but pieces that can be, if you so wish, put together to form wholes. Or just left as single droplets of thoughts and information, ready to be consumed by whoever may find them.

This got me thinking about how I search for and find information, a lot of the time im looking for something specific, a nugget of information that will allow me to proceed with my work without having to devour a whole essay on some subject. [Egghead](https://egghead.io/) does this brilliantly with their videos, short and concise they provide information to the consumer that allows them to proceed with their work, happy in the knowledge that their problem is solved. But as a whole, when all the pieces are put together, they provide a deep dive into a subject. This is how I view a digital garden, or should I say, my digital garden. Nuggets of information that if expanded upon by me will provide a whole.
