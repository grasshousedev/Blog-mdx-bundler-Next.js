There are many ways to make a footer stick to the bottom of a page. The best way, in my opinion uses flexbox

```css
    html, 
    body {
        height: 100%;
    }

    body {
        display: flex;
        flex-direction: column;
    }

    .content {
        flex: 1 0 auto;
    }

    .footer {
        flex-shrink: 0;
    }
```
