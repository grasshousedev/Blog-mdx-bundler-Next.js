> This document assumes you have postgres installed locally and are running psql. Always add a semicolon to the end of all commands.

## Login

To login to to psql:

```bash
psql -U postgres;
```

To login to psql and a database:

```bash
psql -U postgres -d myDatabase;
```

## Create a Database

psql works by allowing you to write SQL commands write in the command line. The database name needs to be camelCase To that end, to create a new database:

```bash
CREATE DATABASE myDatabase;
```

## List out stuff

To show all databases:

```bash
\l;
```

To move into a database:

```bash
\c myDatabase;
```

To show all tables in a database:

```bash
\d+;
```

If you have data in your database you can view all rows with the SQL command:

```sql
SELECT * FROM myDatabase;
```
